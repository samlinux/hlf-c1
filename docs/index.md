# Hyperledger Fabric Learning Path
This is my approach to study Hyperledger Fabric (HLF).

I will cover two perspectives: 

1. The point of view on an application developer who is going to develop an application based on an existing HLF Network.

- The point of view on an administrator who wants to operate, plan and set up an HLF Network.
